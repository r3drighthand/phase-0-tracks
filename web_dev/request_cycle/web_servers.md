# RELEASE 1 QUESTIONS


1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?



2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
- A VPS is a virtual machine sold as SaaS - Software as a Service. It's basically a server with its own version of an operating system and certain resources allocated to the maintenance of said server. Websites are hosted only in special compartments allocated for each site, as opposed to having other websites on the machine affecting the performance of one another. VPSs isolate each website in its own compartment with enough resources to be sufficient and "happy."

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
- It's not a bad idea if you know what you're doing. I've run as root without any problems, but you can really mess up your OS if you're not familiar with Linux, or at the very least compromise an application by mistake.
