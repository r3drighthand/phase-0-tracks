2 hours for jquery:

# Test what I've learned, if I can (10 min)
# Take break (10 min)
# Do more research with same material if helpful, or new material if not (30 min)
# Test again (15 min)
# Take break (10 min)
# Do a little more research (10-15 min)

45 min for jquery project

# Pick one thing and try to do it.
# Take a break midway-through (after 20/25 min)

---------------

# What worked: 
-W3Schools had lots of great references and a general overview of what JQuery is for and how it functions.
-I used The Odin Project for longer explanations. They do a good job of explaining concepts clearly and concisely.

# What didn't work:
-Skimming angry blogs and forum discussions (lots of devs seem to hate jquery)
-Ironically, reading guides that cover JQuery basics and syntax. I needed to brush up on my JS, HTML, and CSS just to understand what certain tutorials were illustrating.
