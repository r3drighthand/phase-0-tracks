In the solo_project directory, create a file called queries.txt. For each SQL query you run, paste both the command and the output (if any) into queries.txt.

Run a SQL query for each of the following:

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
