1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT businesses.name, users.lastname, reviews.stars FROM businesses JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
Lotus Yoga|Pitt|5
Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Pitt|5
Amir's Towing|Pitt|5
Plumbing by Janet|Kaling|2
The Beagle Nightclub|Jolie|1
JoeBob's Sportz Barn|Wonder|3
Sushi World|George|4

2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT businesses.name, users.lastname, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

SELECT businesses.name, users.lastname, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id WHERE businesses.name="Sushi World";
